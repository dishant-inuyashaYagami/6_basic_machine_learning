**Summary of Experiments**:

Among the four models: **Neural Networks** (NN), **Decision Trees** (DT), **SVMs**, and **Naive Bayes**; only **NN** and **DTs** seems most relevant.

NN has performed best in all the domains: text classification, image classification; except when dealing with categorical data, i.e., Cricket Match Prediction.
**DT has outperformed NN when dealing with categorical data.**
**
PS**: For NN, I used the most simple sklearn classifier MLP (just for comparison)
