Summary of Experiments:

Among the four models: Neural Networks (NN), Decision Trees (DT), SVMs, and Naive Bayes; only NN and DTs seems most relevant.

NNs have performed best in all the domains: text classification, image classification; except when dealing with categorical data, i.e., Cricket Match Prediction.
DTs have outperformed NN when dealing with categorical data.
